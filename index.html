                        <h2>Personal Background</h2>
                            <p>I&rsquo;m a San&nbsp;Francisco Bay&nbsp;Area native, born of Chinese&nbsp;descent. I currently live in Oakland and work full-time in San&nbsp;Francsico for an environmental non-profit law firm. I work in the Communications Department on the Digital&nbsp;Team.</p> 
                            <p>Outside of work, I teach Dynamic&nbsp;Mindfulness and Meditation twice a week for an Asian health clinic in Oakland &mdash; fulfilling service for an Integral&nbsp;Health&nbsp;Fellowship that I&rsquo;ve been a part of for the last year and a&nbsp;half.</p>
                            <p>I have two senior dogs: a 14 year-old Pit-bull named &ldquo;T-bone&rdquo; and a 16 year-old Chihuahua/Pomeranian named &ldquo;Pookie&rdquo;.</p>
                            <p>Whenever I have free time, I enjoy volunteering planting trees around the streets of Oakland, tending to my eclectic food and flower garden, or spending time with my partner working on various natural crafts. My specialty is taking the random tidbits of scrap wood from his projects, and spending an excessive amount of time handcarving them and sanding them into little heart pendants. I like how the grain looks on each one &mdash; telling a little story about the tree&rsquo;s life. I like how they feel with no rough edges. I also like that they&rsquo;re made of natural materials, so no unexpected artificial side-effects from spending so much time with them, and one day they&rsquo;ll decay and return back to the&nbsp;Earth. </p>
                
                        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                            <p>I hold a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Community&nbsp;Nutrition. I did graduate studies in Geographic&nbsp;Information&nbsp;Systems (GIS). I&rsquo;ve completed a couple of apprenticeships in Urban&nbsp;Agriculture and Agroecology, as well as teacher-trainings for Trauma-informed Dyanmic&nbsp;Mindfulness, with an emphasis on working with special&nbsp;populations.</p>

                        <h2>Why Full-Stack Coding?</h2>
                            <p>I&rsquo;ve worked in the environmental space for a few years now. Working in the field really showed me how connected everything is on this planet. I wanted to spark that connectivity with others. I tried to do so by working on maps &mdash; that&rsquo;s why I took up GIS, but I found that GIS wasn&rsquo;t enough. I traveled to rural villages, mapping out issues that coffee producers in Central America faced, but the GIS software was so expensive and inaccessible, it wasn&rsquo;t as impactful as I had&nbsp;hoped.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Story-time!</h3>
                                <p>Then I read an environmental sci-fi novel series called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert_bibliography#WorShip_novels_(also_known_as_the_Pandora_Sequence)" target="_blank">Destination Void</a>. In the story, planet Earth was destroyed and the human species left on a spaceship in search of another planet to inhabit. They found one and began to colonize it. When they first arrived on this planet, there was this sentient being called &ldquo;kelp&rdquo;. It was like the seaweed that we know of here, but when someone touched the kelp, they felt all the experience of their ancestors that came before them, <strong><em>and</em></strong> they felt all the experiences of everyone else who had touched the&nbsp;kelp.</p> 
                                <p>As the generations went on, the human species nearly destroyed the kelp, and almost everyone forgot about it. The world fell into a dystopia. Resources were mismanaged and the planet was becoming less hospitable. People were starving and in constant strife. The top leaders were gluttonous and greedy, and kept the limited resources for themselves. The government was secretly investing in building another ship so that a select few elite could leave in search of yet another planet to inhabit. The government controlled the media and censored&nbsp;it.</p>
                                <p>As all this was happening, a small subset of kelp was regenerating. But generations of humans had come and gone without passing down this knowledge of the kelp, so whenever someone came in contact with the regenerated kelp &mdash; rather than seeing the wisdom of their ancestors and the connections with one another, they thought they were going insane. There was a solution to staying on this planet, but it wasn&rsquo;t being received by the&nbsp;people.</p>
                                <p>Although the government was censoring the media, there was this renegade group of journalist who were actively broadcasting news about what was really happening with the world. They were fugitives on the run from the government, but the people trusted them and this group had a specialist who was an expert in technology. The specialist knew how to use technology to broadcast holograms to reach the people in the way that was most effective. One day, the specialist and the kelp finally came into&nbsp;contact.</p>   
                                <p>There was finally a solution to saving the human species &mdash; the kelp, and a way to reach the people &mdash; through the renegade journalists! So the journalists began to broadcast holograms to bridge that gap between the people and the kelp and slowly things became better as people began to re-understand how everyone was connected.</p>
                                <p>I was very inspired by this story. In a way, I felt I had touched the kelp: farming, planting trees, working with land stewards, and more. I thought GIS would be to way to reach people, and it is a useful skill but I&rsquo;m missing a step. I need to learn how to make information about the environment more accessible. Pretty much everywhere that I traveled &mdash; people might not have running water or flushable toilets, but almost <strong><em>everyone</em></strong> had access to a smartphone or were able to access the&nbsp;internet in some other way. From people in the city, to people in villages &mdash; many of us are connected via the web.</p>
                                <p>I think to really make an impact, I would need to learn how to reach people where they&rsquo;re at &mdash; the internet. So, I&rsquo;m hoping through learning full-stack, I can learn how to better create an impactful user experience with front-end development and how to connect it with the facts through back-end&nbsp;development. I hope to combine my experience working with the land, with my skills in geographic information, with coding to create beautiful and informative communication products that will spur people to care, to take action, to go outside and touch the kelp for themselves.</p>
